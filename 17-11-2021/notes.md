# Linked List

> Can you reverse a linked list using recursion?

 Yes we can, but we should not use recursion because our stack has limited size and our linked list can be of any size.   
And hence instead of using recursion we can store all the nodes in a array and then easily reverse it because both of them will take similar space and time.
